# 📚 Face Recognition Attendance System – Web App

This is the web-based part of a face recognition attendance system that I worked on. It’s a full-stack app that handles user management, attendance logging, and interface display. The actual face recognition logic runs separately (written in Python by my teammate), and this web app communicates with it indirectly via stored data.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Students can be added and managed in a simple UI
- Attendance logs are recorded and displayed
- The frontend is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS
- The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB to store user and attendance data

> ⚠️ Note: This repo does **not** contain the Python face recognition logic – this is only the web application.
